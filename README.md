# odin-recipes

In this project I will create a website for a handful of recipes. In the main webpage of the website there will be links to the webpages of each unique recipe. All the webpages will be created by me, but the recipes will probably be copied from the internet. Each recipe webpage will include a description, one image, an unordered list of ingredients and an ordered list of steps to complete a dish.  

I hope that by the end of this project I will have demonstrated at least intermediate knowledge of html and css that I gained from The Odin Project.
